// server is the index of the target server in rf.peers[].

// pass &reply.
// the types of the args and reply passed to Call() must be
// the same as the types of the arguments declared in the
// handler function (including whether they are pointers).
//
// The labrpc package simulates a lossy network, in which servers
// may be unreachable, and in which requests and replies may be lost.
// Call() sends a request and waits for a reply. If a reply arrives
// within a timeout interval, Call() returns true; otherwise
// Call() returns false. Thus Call() may not return for a while.
// A false return can be caused by a dead server, a live server that
// can't be reached, a lost request, or a lost reply.
//
// Call() is guaranteed to return (perhaps after a delay) *except* if the
// handler function on the server side does not return.  Thus there
// is no need to implement your own timeouts around Call().
//
// look at the comments in ../labrpc/labrpc.go for more details.
